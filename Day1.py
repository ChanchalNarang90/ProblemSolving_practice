# Task:The variables and  are already declared and initialized for you. You must:

# Declare  variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
# Read  lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your  variables.
# Use the  operator to perform the following operations:
# Print the sum of  plus your int variable on a new line.
# Print the sum of  plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
# Concatenate  with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.
# Not

i = 4
d = 4.0
s = 'HackerRank'
# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
second_Integer=int(input("Enter secondInteger: "))
second_double=float(input("Enter second Double value: "))
second_string=input("Enter second string:")
# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.
integer_sum= i+second_Integer
print(integer_sum)
# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
double_sum=d+second_double
print(double_sum)
# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
string_concatenate=s+second_string
print(string_concatenate)

# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
# The 's' variable above should be printed first.
